Front-end Engineer Homework Assignment

## Problem:
Build a web page(desktop/mobile) as seen in the mockup file found in the repo. The circles will represent 4 coins with editable values. The input field below, will take a total number input.  The "Calculate" button will trigger a function that determines the smallest amount of coins to be used. This function will generate the "notification" circles for the denominations used where the amount of that coin will be displayed.

The example in the mockup shows that for a total of 18 cents, one 10 cent coin, one 5 cent coin, and three 1 cent coins are being used.

### Design:  
This page should use only html and css for visual elements. Html/css frameworks are ok. The wireframe represents a mobile design; however, it should be responsive, and the desktop version should have the contents centered both vertically and horizontally.

### Functionality:
 1.  Each of the coin circles should allow their values to be edited.
 2.  The calculate function should be written in plain javascript.

### Test Cases:
 1. Coin denominations follow the US coin system in descending order: 25, 10, 5, 1
 2. Coin denominations for the above can be in any order
 3. Assuming a 1 coin will always exist, the other three coin values can be random, example: 25, 10, *6*, 1
